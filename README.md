##  Delivery Performance Analysis Dashboard 

Developed a comprehensive **Delivery Performance Analysis Dashboard** to assess and optimize e-commerce delivery efficiency across multiple departments and global markets.
The goal was to uncover operational inefficiencies and performance gaps in the supply chain by visualizing key metrics such as:

* Average Processing Time
* Late Delivery Rate
* Return Rate Percentage
* Order Status Distribution
* Monthly Order Volume Trends

This analysis enables decision-makers to make data-driven improvements in fulfillment, shipping, and customer satisfaction.
Utilized the following technical tools and skills:

* **Data Analysis & Cleaning:**

  * Cleaned and prepared data using **Python** (pandas library).
  * Wrote and optimized complex SQL queries for data extraction and transformation.
  * Joined multiple tables, applied window functions for ranking and aggregation, and prepared data sources for Tableau.

* **Data Visualization Best Practices:**

  * Applied tree maps, bar charts, and trend lines to display department-wise performance metrics.

* **Performance Metrics Tracked:**

  * Late delivery rate by department
  * Monthly order trends
  * Order status breakdown (e.g., Canceled, Pending, Completed)
  * Return rate distribution by product category
